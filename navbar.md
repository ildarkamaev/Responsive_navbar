# Responsive navbar

Web page with responsive navbar

## WTF is this?

Based on Kevin Powell's video [Create a responsive navigation with no JS!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QKOaTYvYUA) 
I built a webpage responsive navbar.

## What was used
* HTML5 & CSS3
* SASS
* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)

## What I learned
* How to make a hamburger menu navbar using CSS using span and ::before/after classes
* Using checkbox and styling it for use in navbars is handy
* How to create cool underline hover effect using ::before pseudo-classes
* How to customize Font-awesome 

## Problems/Mistakes
* Implementing font awesome was unneccesssarly complex for some reason, but I managed.

## Things left to-do
* Implement media querys in SASS using mixins


## License

Pretty much use it however you like.
